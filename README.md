## About This Repository
This projects was originally provided as part of an internship program.I have worked on understanding, modifying, and enhancing the codebase.

**DevOpsLab Projects** is a collection of **hands-on cloud and DevOps projects** designed for learners and beginners who want to get **real-world experience with AWS, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and serverless architectures**.

Each project is carefully built to demonstrate **practical skills** rather than just theory. By following these projects, you’ll learn **how to design, deploy, and manage scalable and secure cloud applications**—just like in a professional environment.
